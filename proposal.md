We will be making a recipe app. This app will allow the user to input 3 ingredients.
Then, the app will generate a recipe using an api. The user will then have an option
to order food if they dislike the recipe. One screen will have you login, then
the next screen will have you type in 3 ingredients, the next screen will display
a list of possible recipes and a button that says "didn't like it." That button
will go to another screen that lets you order pizza.
