# To Do

## Lily
- https://www.food2fork.com/user/api#
- the above api allows users to input three ingredients to make a recipe, I will figure out how to make this happen!

## Katelyn 
- https://developers.eatstreet.com/endpoint/send-order
  - the above api allows users to order food (not necessarily pizza)
  - figure out how to use it
  
  ## For Later
  - for the language requirement, we can translate the app into Chinese
  - that uses localization
